% General idea
% Come up with a paper on Irreproducibility Top Tips
% Use specific personal examples from the authors to back each tip up

% This is the list we came up with at the workshop
\begin{enumerate}
\item implement everything yourself / don't reuse existing, well tested code wherever possible
\item  don't share anything
\ don't make it clear what irreproducibility means in your context / domain
\item don't make it clear where your method / approximations cannot be / should not be used
\item don't publish your source code, or your implementation
\item  define custom benchmarks
\item  don't describe your experimental setup
\item  give a vague methodology
\item  data formats are boring
\item  use magic numbers everywhere
\item  miss out key parts / fudgy workflow
\item  don't share the raw data you used to build everything
\item  define your own data formats, preferably in binary, mont human or machine readable
\end{enumerate}

% Other questions that came up

Are the trustable minimal information for recomputability  different or overlapping for different domains?
\begin{itemize}
\item in AI alone very different
\item require publishing of algorithm and implementation
\item what stepping of the memory controller in systems domain
\end{itemize}

Is there a Dublin Core - or a set of principles - that we can agree for recomputability?

What about a paper which is essentially theoretical but complex, and an implementation is included to show that it is possible to implement it. Should that implementation be reproducible? Arguably not.
